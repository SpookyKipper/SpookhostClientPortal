# The Spookhost Client Portal Source
## I am too lazy to update this thing, many stuff has changed since I published this code.
This source code is purely for **ACCESSIBILITY**, no support or help will be provided for installing your own instance(s). 
# Installation
#### There will be NO HELP OR SUPPORT PROVIDED. The changes I made on this repo may break certain features. There are API Credentials which are not available in the settings page and require custom configuration of the credentials in the code.
Upload the files and go to `your.domain/install.php`.<br>
For running your own instance, we recommend using:
1.  <a href="https://github.com/mahtab2003/Xera/" target="_blank">Xera</a> - the system that the Spookhost Portal is based on, but discontinued 
2. <a href="https://github.com/GenerateApps/GenerateArea/" target="_blank">GenerateArea</a> - the actively maintained fork of Xera
